# MyBudget
Budget app
Functioning app, with transactions and categories tables
- Accounts table added (17/2)
- Filter (categories and accounts) created (17/2)
- "Export to CSV" function working (sends Transactions, Categories and Accounts csv files via email)
- "Import to CSV" function working + date filter started (20/02)
- Date filter: "All transactions", "Month" and "Custom period" working. Added transaction type to Transaction Activity(22/02)
- Branch created: started working on recurring transactions table, but things were getting too complicated. Will try a different approach (26/02)
